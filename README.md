# GatorMart

GartorMart provides a way for the users to sell and buy used or new products.

The motivation behind the idea is there are many applications where we could buy and sell the products, but there is less focus on the target audience for buying and selling. For example, I could restrict my advertisement to appearing only for the students so that I could dodge many unwanted conversations initiated by users who are less like to complete the transaction. Similarly, a buyer wants to get a computer then buying it from a non-technical person is better because it is not heavily used.

Although it seems like a trivial filter it allows users to buy or sell quickly by reaching more potential audiences and gives an additional dimension to make a prudent decision.

* A user could buy or sell a product.
* One can perform a search based on various factors such as Location, Category, Age, Condition, Price, PostedOn, and many more.
* The ads could be sorted based on Price, PostedOn, SellerRating.
* Google Maps integration for navigation.
* Real-time encrypted messaging between buyer and seller.
